# MLB Pitch Analysis Apps

## Overview
This repository hosts two Streamlit applications designed to analyze MLB pitchers' pitch movement and consistency using 2024 Statcast data.

1. **Shape Consistency App**:
   - Analyze a pitcherâ€™s ability to consistently repeat the shape of their pitches.
   - Search for a pitcher, select a pitch type, and visualize its movement profile along with a consistency score.

2. **Movement Profile Distributions App**:
   - View violin plots of horizontal and vertical movement, as well as velocity distributions, for each pitch type in a pitcher's arsenal.
   - Rank pitches by their shape consistency and compare them to other pitchers throwing the same pitch type.

Both apps utilize the 2024 Statcast monthly data files.
